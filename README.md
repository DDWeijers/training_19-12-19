# reproducible_code_training

Version 0.1.0

here I will put all the scripts and data used and created in the course reproducible code writing


## Project organization

###What does the project do?

This script was designed to add **gene names** to genomic positions in output from the **structural variation caller Manta**.
It requires a *txt* input file, **the *vcf exported by Manta* therefore needs to be parsed and saved as *txt***. 
The gene names can help you filter the, often extensive, output provided by Manta.

### Before starting

Download the get_genes.R script from github/training_19-12-19/src.
For privacy reasons, I cannot share my input data here. 
The input data should at least contain three columns: chromosome (CHROM), start position (POS), end position (END). 
Make sure the column names match the names between the brackets. 
To run the script, change the input and output directories.
